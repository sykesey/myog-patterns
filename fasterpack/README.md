**Faster Pack**

Current status: Prototype - use with care and attention - a starting point for your own designs only at this point !

If using, you will need to adjust the yoke length and strap length to fit your torso - i've sized it for my torso (98cm chest circumference)

Fabric and hardware Specs:

* Pack Fabric: technical waterproof fabric, 200d or higher. Consider a higher weight for pack base.
* Strap fabric: technical fabric - inner side can be spacer mesh or airflow mesh
* Inner seams bound with grosgrain or other binding tape
* 1/2"-5/8" / 13/15mm webbing for webbing ladders
* Dyneema/Ultra stretch mesh or other technical stretch mesh for front pocket
* Spandura / stretch mesh for bottle pockets
* 20 or 25mm webbing for roll-top closure
* 2/3mm shock cord and cord locks for attaching base of straps to side panels and straps to each other
* To link straps either use shock cord, "bunnies" with side release buckles, shock cord with small side release buckles, etc. I used shock cord with small side release buckles


Order of operations:

* Build straps - with webbing ladders on the inside edge for attaching strap linking hardware
* Build yoke
* Attach back panel to base panel
* Build side panels with webbing ladders up sides - evenly space bar tacks at 25mm increments
* Attach Base Panel to Side Panels and to  Front Panel
* Attach Yoke to Back Panel  - use lots of clips to ease the concave yoke into the convex back top
* Build Roll-top with french seam, 25mm double fold at pack top with webbing and side-release buckles - the roll top panel has a small curve to meet the curve of the back panel
* Attach roll-top to top of pack panels
* Bind all seams
* Attach straps to base with threaded shock cord and line lock adjusters
* Attach clips / straps / cord locks on strap webbing ladders
